# Gold_Price_Prediction
This project aims to predict the future prices of gold using two machine learning models, Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The dataset used in this study consists of daily gold prices from January 2008 to May 2018.
In the first part of the project, we explore and analyse the dataset to gain insights into the behaviour of gold prices. We then pre-process the data by handling missing values, scaling, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Next, we use Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models to predict the future prices of gold. We evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared value.
Our results show that both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models can predict gold prices with reasonable accuracy. However, the Random Forest Regressor model outperforms the Linear Regression model in terms of accuracy.
Finally, we provide insights and recommendations based on the predictions made by the models. The findings of this study can be useful for investors, traders, and other stakeholders interested in gold prices.

In this you can also find the detailed implementation of gradient descent and how it optimized the values of weight and biased to make the model more accurate.
